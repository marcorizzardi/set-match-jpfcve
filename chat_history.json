The cards should be visually distinct and easy to identify.\n3.  **Implement the game logic:** This will involve generating a set of cards, determining valid sets, and handling user selections.\n4.  **Implement the timer:** Use `setInterval` or a similar function to track the time taken to solve the game.\n5.  **Implement the scoring system:** Track the player's score based on the number of sets found and the time taken.\n6.  **Integrate the game screen into the app's navigation:** Add a new tab or screen to the app's navigation to allow users to access the game.\n7.  **Remove the modalDemos array:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not relevant to the game.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.
